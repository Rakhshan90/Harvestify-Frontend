# HARVESTIFY

I built Harvestify, a MERN stack auction platform with custom bidding algorithms, designed to create a transparent and efficient experience for farmers and buyers in the agricultural sector.

## Features
1. Provides secure user accounts with separate dashboards for farmers and buyers to manage products and bids.
2. Developed features for live auction updates, automated closing, and email notifications for winners and sellers.  
3. Utilized Tailwind CSS to create a user-friendly and responsive user interface for seamless auction participation.
4. Elimination of middlemen, reduced costs, and direct connections between farmers and buyers.
   
## Tech stack
MongoDb, ExpressJs, React, NodeJs, Redux and Tailwind CSS

## Back-end repository.
